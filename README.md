Spotify Conky with image fix for opaque images.

Conky Spotify ImageFix is an enhanced version of the [original Conky-Spotify](https://github.com/Madh93/conky-spotify) by Madh93. It adds a solution for rendering Spotify album art addressing Conky's compatibility issues with transparent Conky window and images using `transparent-image.lua`, .

## Features
- Displays Spotify album art in Conky.
- Fix for showing album art in a transparent Conky window.
- Compatible with Spotify (with DBus support).

## Requirements
To use this configuration, you need the following tools:
- **Conky**: A lightweight system monitor.
- **ImageMagick**: For album art conversion to a suitable format.
- **Spotify**: With DBus support enabled.

## Why PNG Conversion?
This setup converts Spotify album art from JPG to PNG format using ImageMagick in the `cover.sh` script. The reasons for this conversion are:
- **Reliability**: Conkyâ€™s Cairo backend has native support for PNG, ensuring consistent rendering without black backgrounds or artifacts in transparent Conky windows.
- **Compatibility**: The `transparent-image.lua` script is designed to work with PNG images, avoiding the need for complex modifications to support JPG directly.
- **Quality**: PNG uses lossless compression, preserving the visual quality of album art without compression artifacts.
- **Simplicity**: Converting to PNG with ImageMagick is a robust, well-tested solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing Conky-Spotify setup.

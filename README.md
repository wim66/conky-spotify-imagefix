Conky Spotify with Image Fix is an enhanced version of the [original Conky-Spotify](https://github.com/Madh93/conky-spotify) by Madh93. It resolves compatibility issues with rendering Spotify album art in transparent Conky windows using `transparent-image.lua`.

### Spotify-Conky-Redone

![Sample Spotify-Conky-Redone](preview2.png)

**Spotify-Conky-Redone** is an advanced version of **Conky Spotify with Image Fix**, featuring a Lua-rendered background, colored borders, and optimized performance. It caches album art as PNGs to reduce downloads, eliminates JPG storages. All rendering, previously handled in `conky.text`, is now managed by `display.lua` for greater flexibility.

## Requirements
To use this configuratsion, you need the following tools:
- **Conky**: A lightweight system monitor.
- **ImageMagick**: For album art conversion to a suitable format.
- **Spotify**: With DBus support enabled.

## Why PNG Conversion?s
This setup converts Spotify album art from JPG to PNG format using ImageMagick in the `cover.sh` script. The reasons for this conversion are:
- **Reliability**: Conkyâ€™s Cairo backend has native support for PNG, ensuring consistent rendering without black backgrounds or artifacts in transparent Conky windows.
- **Compatibility**: The `transparent-image.lua` script is designed to work with PNG images, avoiding the need for complex modifications to support JPG directly.
- **Quality**: PNG uses lossless compression, preserving the visual quality of album art without compression artifacts.
- **Simplicity**: Converting to PNG with ImageMagick is a robust, well-tested solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing Conky-Spotify setup.
